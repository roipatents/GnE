GnE

GnE (pronounced "Genie" - the Gender-Name Estimator) takes an incoming XLSX or CSV file and outputs an appended version with additional columns for Gender and Accuracy based upon incoming columns for First Name and Country of Origin along with a summarized analysis of results.

The Gender column will contain one of the following result indicators:

    "F" - Woman - The person is most likely a woman based upon the model data.
    "I" - Indeterminate - There is equal maximum likelihood that the person has two or more possible results of woman, man, or unknown.
    "M" - Man - The persion is most likely a man based upon the model data.
    "-" - Not Available - The combination of First Name and Country of Origin are not contained in the model data.
    "?" - Unknown - The person's gender is unknown based upon the model data.

The Accuracy column will contain the probability that the Gender is correct based upon the model expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1.
